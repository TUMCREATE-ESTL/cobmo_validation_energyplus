# CoBMo Validation EnergyPlus

This repository contains the EnergyPlus model definition and result files which were used to validate the [Control-oriented Building Model (CoBMo)](https://github.com/TUMCREATE-ESTL/cobmo).

# Test cases

| Test case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `1zone_no_window_no_mass` | 1 zone building with only exterior walls, roof and adiabatic floor. Walls and roof are modelled with neglectable heat capacity. |
| `1zone_no_window` | 1 zone building with only exterior walls, roof and adiabatic floor. |
